# Unit Test ROI Analyzer
This repository is a place for project data and source code for the Software Evolution Analysis project for SENG 371 at the University of Victoria. The goal of this project is to come up with an interesting question related to the evolution of software projects, then analysing real code bases to answer it.

**For the Final Project Deliverables (Project 2) please see the appropriate [Wiki Page](https://github.com/gregnr/SoftwareEvolutionAnalysis/wiki/Project-2-Report)**

*For the February 23rd deliverables, please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/gregnr/SoftwareEvolutionAnalysis/wiki)*

## Question
Does the volume of unit tests in a project relate to the frequency of bugs?


## Setup
Install Node.js and its package manager NPM. See [these instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).

Clone the repository:
> git clone [repo url]

Navigate into the repository's directory. Run the command:
> npm install

This will download dependencies used by the program into a **node_modules** directory.

Run the program by entering:
> node src/main.js

This project is still in development.
